GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule </br>
WHEN I open the planner</br>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar</br>
WHEN I scroll down</br>
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours</br>
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day</br>
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future</br>
WHEN I click into a time block</br>
THEN I can enter an event</br>
WHEN I click the save button for that time block</br>
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage</br>
